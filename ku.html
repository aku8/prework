        <i>About Me</i>
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        I was born in 2000 in <i>New York City</i>, and grew up in Long Island. I've lived on the East Coast all my life, moving to <i>New Jersey</i> when I was 7. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the biggest parts of my life is golf, which I started when I was four years old and have been playing ever since. I loved golf from the start, and haven’t slowed down! I now play for Harvard, which has been a dream come true. It’s so much fun getting to practice and play as a team; we won the Ivy League Championships this year, which was our big goal and one of the happiest moments of my year! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of golf, I love good movies, good TV, and good food. I love being around my friends and meeting new people, so I can’t wait for what iX has in store.
